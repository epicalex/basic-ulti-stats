- Each game needs a unique name for this to work
- Click the title to add the game name
- Once you leave the page, you can no longer add any scores or turnovers, and you can't undo
- Saving happens automatically each time you update the score or undo
- Games are only saved on your device/computer, so you won't be able to share results

TODO

- Add database to support game url sharing
